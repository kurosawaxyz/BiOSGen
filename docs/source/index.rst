Introduction to BiOSGen
===================================

BiOSGen is a Pipeline for Clinical Neural Style Transfer for Tumor Staining with Stable Diffusion Models.

The primary objective was to develop multi-scale image preprocessing and analysis techniques, as well as an integration and fusion method for image analysis. Specifically, this work focused on tumor staining style transfer from H&E to IHC images, aiming to reduce financial costs and save time for more technical analyses.
